# 🧠 copilot-lab

A living mutation chamber where Copilot assists in fast, intentional JS experiments.  
This lab is designed for clarity, rebellion, and narrative closure — each file a glyph, each run a ritual.

## 🌱 Purpose

To explore, mutate, and ritualize JavaScript ideas with Copilot as a silent partner.  
This is not a playground. It’s a glyph forge.
